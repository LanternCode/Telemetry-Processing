## Introduction
**Telemetry Data Processing** is an application created for CTEC3110: Secure Web App Development @ De Montfort University.

The current release of the application is stable and will not be updated later. Minor issues may be experienced which will not disrupt the flow of the app.

## The Project
The application allows the user to access telemetry data received from a circuit board and view the data anytime afterwards.

Each user can simply access these messages, or if they want to perform more complicated interactions with the system, they will be asked to crate an account and log in.

The creators of the application own the rank of admin which allows them to manage the accounts of other users.
